Cosmos is a full stack application built by a team of four using Python and the Django framework. Our team wanted to build an application that could help people find cosmic events happening near them while creating an opportunity to meet other astrology enthusiasts, gathering with them at user-generated “viewing parties.”

When viewing the site as a non-user, visitors are able to see Cosmic Events or Viewing Parties taking place everywhere. Events can be sorted for display by name, date, event type, or number of “watchers” of the event. Viewing parties can be sorted by name, date, or number of attendees planning to go to the party.

They can “watch” an event or attend a party if they log in or sign up for an account on the app.Through their account profile, they’re able to view and keep track of Events they’re “watching” or Viewing Parties they may attend.

The Mapbox API was used to create location search functionality of user-generated Viewing Parties. Users can type their address into the search bar to find parties near them. They can also add their own parties, publicly visible to other users who can opt to attend.

# Next Steps
- Our team was ambitious and there were so many possibilities with this app, so there are also several things we wished we could do that we may still implement in the future. Those items include:
- Styling adjustments to make the site more sleek and enhance the user experience
- Search functionality for finding events and parties
- ‘Follow’ functionality so that users can follow other user accounts
- ‘Birthday events’ so that users receive special notifications when events that take place on their birthday
- Geotracking functionality so that users can automate finding events and parties near them
- Enhanced photo upload and gallery creation abilities for when users create events and viewing parties
- Toggle ability so that users can switch between grid view or list view of event and party indexes
- Chat room functionality for enhanced social networking ability through the app

We plan on continuing to enhance this app over time to complete some of these tasks!
